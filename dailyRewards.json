	//Prove it to yourself, do it for yourself!
	//In nature there are neither rewards nor punishments; there are consequences. 
	//Notice the small things. The rewards are inversely proportional.
	//There are no rewards or punishments - only consequences. 
	//What I am suggesting is hard work and it can be slow work, but the rewards are well worth it. 
	//We all learned how to walk and talk by interacting with our environment, with real goals and rewards. Now let's learn how to budget...
	//I've usually found that the greatest rewards in my life come from taking on things that are a little bit scary. 
	// If you're looking for immediate rewards, you're only looking for the money. 
	//Had too much fun, too many rewards. 
	// Set goals that are achievable and know what motivates you and stay focused on that.
	//Keep calm and save money.
	//It takes a village to make this garden! 

	//Success leaves clues, and if you sow the same seeds, you'll reap the same rewards. 
	//Effort only fully releases its reward after a person refuses to quit.
	//The reward of a thing well done is having done it. 
	//Happiness is not a reward - it is a consequence. Suffering is not a punishment - it is a result. 
	// The rewards for those who persevere far exceed the pain that must precede the victory. 
	//When we take time to notice the things that go right - it means we're getting a lot of little rewards throughout the day. 
	//What people want most of all are social rewards, especially the respect of their peers. 


	//This joy of discovery is real, and it is one of our rewards. So too is the approval of our work by our peers. 
	//Every project has challenges, and every project has its rewards. 
	//Giving credit where credit is due is a very rewarding habit to form. Its rewards are inestimable. 
	//Serendipity always rewards the prepared. 
	//Balance is if you try hard and you work hard, then the rewards are that what you put in and what is what you get out of it.
